# F1Race for Arduino
A simple Formula 1 themed endless racer for Arduino and 16x2 displays.

I created this on my second day of experimenting with an Arduino Uno. It's a two button racing game with custom sprites which runs forever or until the race car crashes, resulting in game over. The code is extremely simple, but feel free to use it as you please.

# Requirements
An Arduino and a 16x2 character LCD display, as well as two pushbuttons. I may add sound in the future, in which case it will require an additional piezo buzzer.
